# sveltekit-view-transitions

Demo showing how to use [view transitions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/) in a SvelteKit app. A full writeup of how it works can be found [on my blog](https://geoffrich.net/posts/page-transitions-1/).

Originally based on the [Shared Element Transitions Google CodeLab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/create-an-instant-and-seamless-web-app#5), but ported to SvelteKit.
